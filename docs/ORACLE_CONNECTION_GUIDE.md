# Oracle Autonomous Database Connection Guide

## Current Status:  Wallet Configuration Working
Your Oracle wallet files are properly organized and the connection is reaching the Oracle Cloud servers. 

## Issue: Database Instance Paused
**Error ORA-12506** indicates your Oracle Autonomous Database is currently **STOPPED/PAUSED** to save costs.

## How to Start Your Database:

### 1. Login to Oracle Cloud Console
- Go to: https://cloud.oracle.com/
- Sign in with your Oracle account

### 2. Navigate to Your Database
- Click "Database" in the main menu
- Click "Autonomous Database" 
- Find your database (likely named something like "yjxu7nia1a0sj43k")

### 3. Start the Database
- Click on your database name
- You'll see the status as "STOPPED" 
- Click the **"Start"** button
- Wait 2-3 minutes for it to start

### 4. Verify Connection
Once started, run this test:
```bash
cd server
node test-oracle-connection.cjs
```

## Database Management Tips:
- **Auto-pause**: Free tier databases auto-pause after 7 days of inactivity
- **Manual stop**: You can manually stop/start to manage costs
- **Always-free**: 2 databases with 1 OCPU each are always free
- **Storage**: 20GB storage per database (always free)

## Next Steps After Starting:
1.  Test connection (should work once started)
2.  Create database tables using `oracle_schema.sql`
3.  Import your PostgreSQL data
4.  Update application to use Oracle storage

## Connection Details:
- **Service**: `yjxu7nia1a0sj43k_high`
- **User**: `ADMIN`
- **Wallet**: Properly configured 
- **Status**: Database needs to be started 

The setup is working perfectly - you just need to start the database instance!
