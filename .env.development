# Development Environment Overrides
# This file overrides .env values during local development (npm run dev)

# API routes are served from the same domain using Vercel serverless functions
# No need to specify a separate API URL

# Copy other VITE_ variables from .env if needed
# Note: .env is still loaded first, then .env.development overrides
